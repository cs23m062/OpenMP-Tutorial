## 📚 Course Structure

The course is divided into progressive levels — from fundamentals to advanced topics — with theory, annotated code, performance tips, and assignments.

### ✅ Week-by-Week Curriculum

| Week | Topic | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Introduction to OpenMP** | Parallelism basics, OpenMP setup, compiling with `-fopenmp` |
| 2 | **Parallel Regions & Threads** | `#pragma omp parallel`, thread IDs, private/shared variables |
| 3 | **Work Sharing Constructs** | `#pragma omp for`, scheduling policies (static, dynamic, guided) |
| 4 | **Matrix-Vector & Matrix-Matrix Multiplication** | Parallelizing real-world numeric kernels |
| 5 | **Tasks & Task Queues** | `#pragma omp task`, dependencies, task scheduling |
| 6 | **Synchronization** | `critical`, `atomic`, `barrier`, `ordered`, `flush` |
| 7 | **Reduction & Performance Tuning** | `reduction`, cache effects, false sharing, load balancing |
| 8 | **Advanced Topics** | Nested parallelism, OpenMP 5.0+ features, SIMD & memory affinity |
| 9 | **Projects and Benchmarks** | Parallel prefix sum, image convolution, Mandelbrot set, etc. |
| 10 | **Final Assignment** | Performance-optimized multi-threaded program from scratch |

```c
// hello_world.c
#pragma omp parallel
{
    printf("Hello from thread %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
}
```

Output:

```
Hello from thread 0
Hello from thread 1
...
```
